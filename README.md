Helloo!!


My name is Gustavo Richard, as you may have seen in the corner ðŸ˜…

I'm a Front-end Developer, with focus on mobiles, but sometimes I take a chance on the web too.

Usualy I use bare React Native projects, but know how to use <img src="https://static-00.iconduck.com/assets.00/expo-icon-512x462-3a87htea.png" height="20px"/> Expo, if needed.
